# ðŸ’¬ WebSocket Chat Overlay for OBS

YouTube Livestream chat overlay in your OBS, streamlined.

## UNMAINTAINED.

Sorry. You may ask why, but it's happened because something unwanted happens.

If you want to know, this thing is created especially for [**Choco Latte**](https://youtube.com/@ChocoLatteCh), a Virtual YouTuber based in Indonesia. Now this project is half way from finished progress, but she suddenly decides to stopping her process as Virtual YouTuber & Virtual Streamer. So, I decided to stop this project too.

> Farewell and thank you, Choco. I will always waiting for your comeback. :sob:
